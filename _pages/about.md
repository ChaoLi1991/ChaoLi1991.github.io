I am currently a third year PhD Candidate co-supervised by Prof. [Wei Liu](http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~wliu/) and Prof. [Cheng Deng](http://see.xidian.edu.cn/faculty/chdeng/) at [Xidian University](http://www.xidian.edu.cn/). Before that I obtained my B.S. degree from [Inner Mongolia University of Science and Technology](http://www.imust.cn/) in 2014.
